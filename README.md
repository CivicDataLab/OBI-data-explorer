## Open Budgets India - Data Explorer

---
The objective of this notebook is to demonstrate the exploration of the [OpenBudgetsIndia](openbudgetsindia.org/) (OBI) platform right from our :heart: programming environment, in this case `R`. 

For this use-case we will explore the budget allocation data for the **Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change** :tree: for the year **2020/21**

We will use the [ckanr](https://github.com/ropensci/ckanr) package developed by the amazing folks at [ROpenSci](https://ropensci.org/). This is used to read and update data from [CKAN](https://ckan.org/) instanes. Since, OBI is yet another CkAN instance, this packages works perfectly to read and explore (and write as well) data from and to the [Open Budgets India](openbudgetsindia.org/) platform. 

_Note: Please check the [ckanr Github repo](https://github.com/ropensci/ckanr) for documentation and more such examples_
