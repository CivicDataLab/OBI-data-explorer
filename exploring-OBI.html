<h3>üìì Why another Notebook ?</h3>
<p>The objective of this notebook is to demonstrate the exploration of the <a href="openbudgetsindia.org/">OpenBudgetsIndia</a> (OBI) platform right from our ‚ù§Ô∏è programming environment, in this case <code>R</code>.</p>
<p>For this use-case we will explore the budget allocation data for the <strong>Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change</strong> üå¥ for the year <strong>2020/21</strong></p>
<p>We will use the <a href="https://github.com/ropensci/ckanr">ckanr</a> package developed by the amazing folks at <a href="https://ropensci.org/">ROpenSci</a>. This is used to read and update data from <a href="https://ckan.org/">CKAN</a> instanes. Since, OBI is yet another CkAN instance, this packages works perfectly to read and explore (and write as well) data from and to the <a href="openbudgetsindia.org/">Open Budgets India</a> platform.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><em>Note: Please check the <a href="https://github.com/ropensci/ckanr">ckanr Github repo</a> for documentation and more such examples</em></p>

<p>This organsiation (or Ministry) has data from 2011/12 right till 2020/21. Since we‚Äôre interested in the budget allocation for 2020/21, let us now see how we can access the data within this dataset (or a <code>package</code>)</p>
</div>
<div id="step-5---viewing-a-package" class="section level3">
<h3>Step 5 - üìß Viewing a package</h3>
<p>A package (or a dataset) contains several files within. For this analysis, we would like to get access to the tabular datasets or a <strong>CSV</strong> which has allocation details for several important budget heads.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Get the package ID

<h3>Step 6 - ‚è∫ Reading data from a file</h3>
<p>Data can easily be exported as a data frame which is a suitable format for analysing this data.</p>
<p><code>ckanr implements a dplyr SQL interface to CKAN's datastore. You can access any resource in the datastore directly using only the CKAN resource ID. Note: this will only work for resources which were uploaded successfully to the datastore - they will show the green &quot;Data API&quot; button in CKAN.</code></p>
